PM DOS API translator allows the protected-mode program to call DOS
services directly, via the familiar int 21h and similar techniques.
It is usually a part of the DPMI server and is used by the DOS extenders.
Unfortunately, many DPMI servers do not contain the DOS API translator,
and as a result, some DOS extenders fail to run.

This is a port of dosemu's DOS API translator, that can be installed as
a TSR to provide the API translation services to protected-mode programs.
