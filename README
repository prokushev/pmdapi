PM DOS API translator allows the protected-mode program to call DOS
services directly, via the familiar int 21h and similar techniques.
While it may be a part of the DOS extender, the common practice is to
put it directly into a DPMI server instead, to save the DOS extenders
a great deal of work. Unfortunately, many DPMI servers do not contain
the DOS API translator, and as a result, some DOS extenders fail to run.

This is a port of dosemu's DOS API translator, that can be installed as
a TSR to provide the API translation services to protected-mode programs.
